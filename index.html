            <h3>Why do you use social media?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            Is it to keep in touch with friends and family? To find new videos or TV shows to watch? 
            To fill spare time whilst waiting for your order at Subway to finally arrive? No matter 
            the reason, there is one indisputable fact about social media that we can all agree on: 
            it is everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of us have welcomed social networks into our lives without a second thought.
            But what impact these technologies have on our mental wellbeing? Does scrolling your 
            feed actually make you feel better? Or does it do more harm than good?
        </p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h1>Social Media is everywhere</h1>
            
            <h2>Average time spent using social networks per day (by region)</h2>
            <!-- Graph 1A -->
            <div id="usage"></div>
            <p> 
                Over the last 12 years, the amount of time we spend on social media has increased drastically (Statista, 2024). 
                In the Asia-Pacific region (which includes Australia), the average usage time peaked in 2022, at 2 hours and 18
                minutes per day.          
            </p>

            <p>
                The enormity of social media (SM), especially amongst youth, is reinforced when we look at the graph below. Nearly
                all of Generation (Gen) Z, internet users aged 16-24, are on SM and they are the biggest adopters out of any 
                generation. This makes Gen Z highly susceptible to both the positive and negative effects of these apps.

            <h1>When does social media become a problem?</h1>

            <p>
                The technologies that were meant to bring us closer together, can actually lead us to drift further apart. 
                Research shows that <strong>how</strong> you use social media has a significant effect on whether it improves
                 or damages your wellbeing.

                <h3>How do I know if I have an unhealthy relationship with SM?</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                Academics are still figuring out the answer, but generally speaking, if you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>spend an excessive amount of time on SM</li>
                <li>socially isolate, that is lack social contact or support</li>
                <li>have given up pleasurable activities outside of social media</li>
            </ul>

            <p>then you may be engaging in problematic SM use.</p>

            <h2>Problematic social media use and anxiety disorder symptoms</h2>
            <!-- Graph 2A -->
            <div id="symptoms"></div>
            <p>
                The graphs above are sourced from a survey of Australian independent secondary school students. 
                Students were considered problematic social media users if they met both of the following criteria:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    were often being worried or uncomfortable when unable to access their social media accounts
                </li>
                <li>
                    often found it difficult to relax or sleep after spending time on social networking sites
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>    
                We see an increase in the severity of anxiety disorder symptoms amongst problematic SM users,
                as they spend longer and longer on these apps.

                Young adults are the most anxious age group in Australia. 
                They're also most likely to use social media to avoid missing out on things or to keep up with their favourite celebrities.
                Whilst these habits can seen harmless, 
            </p>

            <p> 
                When we turn to the census data, it’s clear that anxiety disorders, especially social phobia, are prevalent and have been increasing drastically over the past 17 years and young adults have always been the age group most badly affected.
                However, what users do on these apps matters as much as their screen time. 
                Active SM use involves direct interaction with other people, such as posting or direct messaging. In contrast, passive SM use is about monitoring other users without direct engagement. Researchers find that socially anxious users are especially likely to engage passively. This is  generally associated with poorer psychological wellbeing as it facilitates unhealthy comparisons and envy.
                Looking at the data, it's apparent that active social media behaviors, like posting photos, has decreased in the last decade, whilst passive behaviors like following celebrities or brands has increased or remained constant. Whilst this doesn’t necessarily indicate that more users are socially anxious, it does suggest that more are at risk of becoming socially anxious.
                McCutcheon et al. (2016e) found that participants with higher scores on all three dimensions of CW reported higher levels of dominance, submission, separation, and interactional reactivity during conflict with a romantic partner; higher anxiety in intimate relationships; and were more likely to endorse soulmate beliefs
                (Celeb worship is correlated with anxiety and depression)
                Entertainment-social CW correlated significantly and positively with anxiety, social dysfunction and depressive symptoms, while both intense-personal and borderline-pathological CW correlated significantly and positively with anxiety and depressive symptoms.

                An article from Salford University:
                https://hub.salford.ac.uk/psytech/2021/08/10/bergen-social-media-addiction-scale/

You spend a lot of time thinking about social media or planning how to use it.
You feel an urge to use social media more and more.
You use social media in order to forget about personal problems.
You have tried to cut down on the use of social media without success.
You become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using social media.
You use social media so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies.
https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-psychology/resource/signs-of-unhealthy-social-media-habits-mental-health-practitioners-should-spot#:~:text=Posting%20too%20many%20photos%20daily,and%20photos%20throughout%20the%20day.


Checking social media as soon as you wake up before you get out of bed.
Mindless scrolling through the news feed for too long.
Posting too many photos daily, such as photos of each meal you eat or each activity of the day.
Excessive use of hashtags in your communication outside of social media.
Anxiously checking and re-checking for likes and comments on your posts and photos throughout the day. 
Not knowing when and what not to share.
Hopping on social media too often while out with friends and family.
Deleting posts that don’t get enough likes and comments.
Checking notifications every time your phone dings or buzzes.
Comparing yourself excessively to other people based on what they share on social media. 


The research prove that FOMO and celebrity worship harms mental wellbeing and young people are the primary victims of these harmful digital habits.

                What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life
                https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/
                Harvard study, almost 80 years old, has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier
                The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health,” said Robert Waldinger, director of the study, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. “Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.”
                Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. That finding proved true across the board among both the Harvard men and the inner-city participants.
                Several studies found that people’s level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.
                “When we gathered together everything we knew about them about at age 50, it wasn’t their middle-age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old,”

                Finding time to take care of your mind and body can feel impossible. But the answer isn’t a better workout routine or sleep app. It’s changing your mindset. By challenging your assumptions about self-care, you can find an approach that works for you.

Self-care can look different for different people. It could be watching your favorite TV show at the end of a long day, or turning off your phone. Only you can determine what your mind, body, and spirit need to thrive.
To figure out what you need, start by simply noticing when you feel invigorated and when you feel drained. Look for patterns.
You should also look out for all-or-nothing thinking, as it can cause you to put too much pressure on yourself and avoid making changes at all.
From there, you can start to explore small, doable changes that work in the context of your whole life
                There is no one-size-fits all solution to better wellbeing, but some tips include:</p>

                            It can make a real difference having someone to talk to. To hear what you have to say. And to give you advice.
