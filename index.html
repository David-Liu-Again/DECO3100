            <h1>How long do you spend on social media?</h1>
            <p>Social media has officially peaked. Since the pandemic peak, average
                daily time spent on social media has
                leveled off or declined across most
                regions. These shifts suggest that time spent
                on social media has reached a ceiling.
                While we see more drastic fluctuations
                in emerging regions like the Middle East
                & Africa, no other regions’ daily use has
                changed by more than 6 minutes in
                either direction in any given wave over
                the past 3 years. North America is the
                only outlier, with usage continuing to
                tick upward past its lockdown peak.</p>

            <p>When we look at the parcentages of each generation that use social media, we see exactly just how pervasive it is. Generally, younger generations are more active on SM. 
                The 16-24 age group in particular is active on Tiktok, Instagram and Youtube.
                https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/for-us-gen-z-adults-and-millennials-social-media-is-a-way-of-life
                Part of the reason younger adults find it hard to limit social media use is because social media has become woven into the fabric of their lives. Prior to the advent of social media, Americans received news from a variety of traditional sources, such as broadcast TV and cable news programs, along with newspapers, magazines and radio. The survey found that today, the majority (55%) of social media users in the US get most of their news through social media. Over three-quarters (77%) of Gen Z adults and two-thirds (67%) of millennials rely on social media for news of current events. 
                In contrast, only 28% of baby boomers and seniors report getting most of their news from social media.
                In addition to news, the majority (58%) of those Americans using social media log in to decide what TV shows and movies to watch. The survey data reveals that the vast majority of Gen Z adults (84%) and millennials (73%) rely on social media for TV/video entertainment discovery. Even though the majority of baby boomers and seniors are active on social media, most do not use social media for content discovery, preferring to use more traditional sources, such as advertisements, TV schedule guides and online video library searches/recommendations.

            <h1>When does it become a problem?</h1>
            
            <p>O’Day & Heimberg (2021) describe problematic use as spending excessive amounts of time on social media, whilst socially isolating and forgoing other pleasurable activities. A survey of 481 of individuals in Bangladesh found that users that spend more time on these apps experience more intense anxiety symptoms, such as over-worrying and restlessness Problematic SMU
                compulsive or excessive time spent online, decreased time spent with friends or doing other pleasurable activities, social isolation’
                problematic SMU has been defined in terms of frequency rather than pattern of use
                Both socially anxious and lonely individuals engage online more problematically and seek out social support on social media, potentially to compensate for lack of in-person support
                preference for and problematic use of social media have the potential to predict experiences of social anxiety and loneliness.
                Socially anxious individuals seem to be at particularly elevated risk of engaging more frequently and more passively on social media
                Furthermore, they frequently engage in negative upward social comparisons, in which they view themselves more negatively in comparison to other people
                Socially anxious individuals are at risk for feeling particularly lonely

                https://hrcc.cas.msu.edu/news/problematic-social-media-use-meshi.pdf
                problematic social media use
was significantly associated with decreased real-life social support and increased social support on social media.
Importantly, real-life social support was then associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and social isolation,
while social support on social media was not associated with these mental health measures. Our findings reveal
the value of real-life social support when considering the relationship between problematic social media use and
mental health.

We found that both greater attachment anxiety and less avoidance in attachment relationships were associated with problematic use of social media. The data further indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of attachment anxiety on problematic social media use through general feelings of psychological well-being, suggesting that individuals characterized by anxious attachment styles may be using social media as a means of enhancing psychological well-being. As psychological well-being was found to be negatively associated with problematic social media use, our findings bolster calls for enhancing young people's well-being. However, causality cannot be fully established due to the cross-sectional design of this study.

            <!-- Graph 2A -->
            <div id="symptoms"></div>
            <p>This database is composed of 951 participants who provided self-report data online in their school classrooms. The data was collected in 2016 and 2017. The dataset is 509 males (54%) and 442 females (46%). Their ages ranged from 12 to 16 years (M = 13.69, SD = 0.72). Seven participants did not report their age. The majority were born in Australia (N = 849, 89%). The next most common countries of birth were China (N = 24, 2.5%), the UK (N = 23, 2.4%), and the USA (N = 9, 0.9%). Data were drawn from students at five Australian independent secondary schools.
                The data contains item responses for the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS; Spence, 1998) which is composed of 44 items. The Social media question asked about frequency of use with the question “How often do you use social media?”. The response options ranged from constantly to once a week or less. Items measuring Fear of Missing Out were included and incorporated the following five questions based on the APS Stress and Wellbeing in Australia Survey (APS, 2015). These were “When I have a good time it is important for me to share the details online; I am afraid that I will miss out on something if I don’t stay connected to my online social networks; I feel worried and uncomfortable when I can’t access my social media accounts; I find it difficult to relax or sleep after spending time on social networking sites; I feel my brain burnout with the constant connectivity of social media. Internal consistency for this measure was α = .81. Self compassion was measured using the 12-item short-form of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF; Raes et al., 2011).

                When we turn to the census data, it’s clear that anxiety disorders, especially social phobia, are prevalent and have been increasing drastically over the past 17 years and young adults have always been the age group most badly affected.
                However, what users do on these apps matters as much as their screen time. 
                Active SM use involves direct interaction with other people, such as posting or direct messaging. In contrast, passive SM use is about monitoring other users without direct engagement. Researchers find that socially anxious users are especially likely to engage passively. This is  generally associated with poorer psychological wellbeing as it facilitates unhealthy comparisons and envy.
                Looking at the data, it's apparent that active social media behaviors, like posting photos, has decreased in the last decade, whilst passive behaviors like following celebrities or brands has increased or remained constant. Whilst this doesn’t necessarily indicate that more users are socially anxious, it does suggest that more are at risk of becoming socially anxious.
                McCutcheon et al. (2016e) found that participants with higher scores on all three dimensions of CW reported higher levels of dominance, submission, separation, and interactional reactivity during conflict with a romantic partner; higher anxiety in intimate relationships; and were more likely to endorse soulmate beliefs
                (Celeb worship is correlated with anxiety and depression)
                Entertainment-social CW correlated significantly and positively with anxiety, social dysfunction and depressive symptoms, while both intense-personal and borderline-pathological CW correlated significantly and positively with anxiety and depressive symptoms.

                https://hub.salford.ac.uk/psytech/2021/08/10/bergen-social-media-addiction-scale/

You spend a lot of time thinking about social media or planning how to use it.
You feel an urge to use social media more and more.
You use social media in order to forget about personal problems.
You have tried to cut down on the use of social media without success.
You become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using social media.
You use social media so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies.

Checking social media as soon as you wake up before you get out of bed.
Mindless scrolling through the news feed for too long.
Posting too many photos daily, such as photos of each meal you eat or each activity of the day.
Excessive use of hashtags in your communication outside of social media.
Anxiously checking and re-checking for likes and comments on your posts and photos throughout the day. 
Not knowing when and what not to share.
Hopping on social media too often while out with friends and family.
Deleting posts that don’t get enough likes and comments.
Checking notifications every time your phone dings or buzzes.
Comparing yourself excessively to other people based on what they share on social media. 


The research prove that FOMO and celebrity worship harms mental wellbeing and young people are the primary victims of these harmful digital habits.

                What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life
                https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/
                Harvard study, almost 80 years old, has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier
                The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health,” said Robert Waldinger, director of the study, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. “Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.”
                Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. That finding proved true across the board among both the Harvard men and the inner-city participants.
                Several studies found that people’s level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.
                “When we gathered together everything we knew about them about at age 50, it wasn’t their middle-age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old,”

                Finding time to take care of your mind and body can feel impossible. But the answer isn’t a better workout routine or sleep app. It’s changing your mindset. By challenging your assumptions about self-care, you can find an approach that works for you.

Self-care can look different for different people. It could be watching your favorite TV show at the end of a long day, or turning off your phone. Only you can determine what your mind, body, and spirit need to thrive.
To figure out what you need, start by simply noticing when you feel invigorated and when you feel drained. Look for patterns.
You should also look out for all-or-nothing thinking, as it can cause you to put too much pressure on yourself and avoid making changes at all.
From there, you can start to explore small, doable changes that work in the context of your whole life

                            It can make a real difference having someone to talk to. To hear what you have to say. And to give you advice.
